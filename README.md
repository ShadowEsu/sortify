# SORTIFY



## 📋 Description
A machine-learning-powered web application designed to help users correctly sort waste. By simply uploading a photo or capturing an image via a mobile device, the application identifies the object and determines whether it is recyclable or should be disposed of in the general trash. The goal of this project is to reduce "wish-cycling" (throwing non-recyclable items in the recycling bin) and promote better waste management habits through accessible technology.
